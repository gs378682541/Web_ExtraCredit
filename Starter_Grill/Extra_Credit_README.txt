First, I finish all the function like StarterGrill demo (15 pts)

Second, I add sign in and sign up function (5 pts)

Third, when sign in, it will keep session until time out.

Forth, I add an Admin account. And Admin can destroy the user. But Admin can't change username.

Fifth, you should run rake db:reset to reset database when first run.
